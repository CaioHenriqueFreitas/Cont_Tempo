# Cont_Tempo
Website also used by the "DoeSangue" project, responsible for registrate the times that each person consume in each process of the blood donation

I developed this web application back in 2015. It was a simple communication between the volunteer's smartphone browser and the
MySQL database. It was made using a local network, because the internet in the university was very unstable. Each person gained a number that was used in order to index the database, and the volunteer's that was working during the blood donation pressed the buttons 
indicating in which process the person was. After that, in the "server" (my computer) we made a report with the times from each person, 
and treated then using Excel in order to prove that the called "Dead time" (when the blood donor has to wait until pass to the next step)
was almost vanquished using the schedule website.

The website may not work properly because the databases are missing.
