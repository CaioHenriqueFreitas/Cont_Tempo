# Cont_Tempo
Website also used by the "DoeSangue" project, responsible for registrate the times that each person consume in each process of the blood donation

This web application was developed by me back in 2015. It's a simple communication between the volunteer's cellphone browser and the
MySQL database. It was made using a local network, because the internet in the university was very unstable. Each person gained a nu
mber that was used in order to index the database, and the volunteer's that was working during the blood donation press the buttons 
indicating in wich process the person was.
